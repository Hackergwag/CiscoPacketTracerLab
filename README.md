<h1>Network Configuration With Cisco Packet Tracer</h1>

 ### [Video Tutorials Explaining Integrity Check In Details](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2oh497p9de41r45/UABP4181.mp4/file)

<h2>Description</h2>
The project involves using Cisco Packet Tracer to guide users through a comprehensive network configuration process. The key elements of the project are as follows:

Cisco Switch and Router Configuration: Users will be guided through the configuration of Cisco switches and routers using the IOS CLI, ensuring they understand the fundamental commands and procedures required to set up these devices.

Firewall Configuration: The project will demonstrate how to configure a firewall to enable and disable ICMP (ping) packets. This will show the importance of firewall settings in network security and how they control traffic flow.

End Devices with Different IPs: Users will configure two end devices connected to a Cisco router, each with different IP addresses, and verify successful message transmission between them. This demonstrates the basics of IP addressing and routing.

End Devices with Same IP: The configuration will also include two end devices connected to a Cisco switch that are attempting to send packets with the same IP address. This scenario will highlight the issues that arise with IP conflicts and how switches handle such situations.

Static Routing on Routers: The project will cover static routing configuration across four routers, providing a step-by-step guide using the CLI. This will help users understand how to manually configure routes in a network.

VLAN Configuration: Users will learn to configure VLANs on a Cisco switch using the CLI to reduce broadcast traffic. This section emphasizes the importance of VLANs in network segmentation and efficiency.

Dynamic Routing with RIP: The project will introduce dynamic routing using the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), showcasing how routers automatically update routing tables.

Server Configuration Across Branch Offices: Finally, the project will cover server configuration that allows communication between two different branch offices located in different states. This setup will demonstrate how to establish and maintain communication across a wide area network (WAN), emphasizing the global reach of network configurations.

This project aims to provide a hands-on, practical understanding of network configuration, emphasizing both security and efficiency in various networking scenarios.
